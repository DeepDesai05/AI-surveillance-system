# 🛡️ AI-Based Smart Surveillance System

An advanced computer vision system that uses deep learning to detect potential threats and intrusions in real-time, such as weapons, violence, restricted zone entries, and wall jumps.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time **weapon detection** (gun, knife)
- **Wall jump** detection using motion cues
- **Restricted area** intrusion alerts
- Detects **normal vs. violent behavior**
- Trained with **YOLOv8** on a custom dataset
- Can integrate **Vision-Language Models (VLM)** for scene understanding
- Future goal: automatic alert to authorities with detection snapshot

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python, OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- PyTorch
- Streamlit / Flask (optional)
- Numpy, Matplotlib
- Vision-Language Model integration (e.g., CLIP, BLIP – future scope)
